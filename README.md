The war-card-game project uses HTML, CSS, and jquery. It creates a deck of cards, shuffles and splits the deck, and waits for the next turn button to be pressed. When the next turn button is pressed, player 1's card is displayed. When the next turn button is pressed again player 2's card is displayed. The 2 cards  are then compared. The player with the higher card takes both cards and places them on the bottom of their stack. When the next turn button is pressed again, the player's stack size is displayed. This cycle repeats until one player has no more cards and the other player wins. If both cards have the same rank, this is called the war state. Then each player places one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher card face up then takes all 6 cards and places them at the bottom of their stack. If the face up cards are also the same rank then the process continues until the face up cards are of different value and a player wins all the cards in the war stack. When the New Game button is pressed the game starts over. Aces are high.
